## Problem Statement

**H2:** You have the job, the skills, the track record. So why does everything feel heavy?

**Body:** You're getting things done. People around you think you're fine. But you spend half your energy managing the noise in your head. You start things and lose interest. You know what you should do but can't make yourself do it. The motivation that used to come naturally now takes effort you don't have.

## Symptoms

**H2:** Sound familiar?

- Your head is always running, but your life feels like it's standing still
- You have ten things on your list and can't start any of them
- You're tired in a way that sleep doesn't fix
- You've outgrown where you are, but you can't see what's next
- You keep reading, researching, planning, and none of it moves the needle

## About

**H2:** Hi, I'm Alex.

**Body:**

I spent 8+ years as a software engineer. Remote work, good salary, flexible schedule. From the outside it looked great. From the inside I was foggy, tired, and going through the motions.

I started doing the inner work: therapy, journaling, honest conversations. Slowly things got clearer. I stopped running on autopilot and started making choices that actually felt right.

People around me noticed and started asking for help. That turned into coaching 30+ people through the same kind of fog. Engineers, founders, creatives. People who are good at what they do but lost the signal somewhere along the way.

## Process (How It Works)

**H2:** How It Works

1. Book a free intro call. We talk, I listen, we see if it's a fit.
2. If it makes sense, we set up a coaching plan around what you're dealing with.
3. Sessions happen over video. We go where the real problems are.
4. I keep my roster small. You get my full attention, not a template.

**Closing:** The intro call is free. If it's not the right fit, I'll tell you.

## CTA Section

**H2:** If any of this sounds like you, let's talk.

**Subhead:** 30 minutes on a call. No sales pitch. Just a conversation.

**CTA:** Book a free call

## FAQ

**Q: What actually happens in a session?**
A: We get on a video call and talk about what's going on. I ask questions that help you see things you're too close to notice. I don't give advice or tell you what to do. You leave with clarity on what's actually going on and what to do about it.

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: People in tech, mostly. Engineers, founders, creatives. People who are smart and capable but feel stuck, foggy, or like they're going through the motions. If you've been thinking "I should be further along by now," we should probably talk.

**Q: How is this different from therapy?**
A: Therapy digs into the past. Coaching is about the present and what's next. We focus on what you want, what's in the way, and how to move. That said, if I think therapy would help you more, I'll say so.

**Q: What if I'm not sure this is for me?**
A: Book the intro call anyway. It's free, it's 30 minutes, and worst case you get a useful conversation out of it. I'll be honest about whether I can help.
