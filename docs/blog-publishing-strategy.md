# Blog Publishing Strategy — Mind Design Studio

## Key Principle: Don't Bulk-Publish 50+ Posts at Once

### Risks of Bulk Publishing on a New DR 0 Site
- Google's "Scaled Content Abuse" policy actively penalizes bulk publishing at scale on new domains
- Publishing velocity is a tracked signal — sudden spikes trigger manual review
- Crawl budget waste: many posts won't get crawled/indexed for weeks
- No feedback loop to learn what works

### AI Content Warning (2025)
- Google's Jan 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines explicitly check for AI-generated content
- Keep AI-authored content under ~30% of total output, or heavily edit with personal expertise
- Generic AI content won't rank; personal coaching experience is the differentiator
- Google penalizes "scaled content abuse" — bulk low-value AI content on new domains is high risk

## Recommended Publishing Schedule

### Launch (Week 0)
- Seed blog with **10-15 foundational posts** (Tier 1 + Tier 4 keywords)
- Gives blog substance, enables internal linking
- Google is fine with a launch batch

### Weeks 1-12
- Publish **2-3 posts/week** from Tier 2 and Tier 3
- HubSpot data: 16+ posts/month = 3.5x more traffic
- Consistency trains Googlebot to crawl regularly

### Month 4+
- Update older posts with fresh data
- Expand top-performing content
- Build backlinks

## Publishing Frequency Benchmarks

| Strategy | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 50 posts at once | Risky — looks like scaled content abuse, poor indexing |
| 2-4 posts/week consistently | Optimal — active site signal, regular indexing, iterative |
| 1 post/week minimum | Safe floor — sustainable, builds authority over 6 months |

## Key Data Points
- HubSpot: 16+ posts/month = 3.5x more traffic, 4.5x more leads
- Traffic impact shows after 3-6 months of consistent posting
- New sites should aim for 6-8 posts/month around key topic clusters
- Plan to review and update top posts every 3-6 months
