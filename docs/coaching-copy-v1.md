## Problem Statement

**H2:** You're not broken. You're just stuck.

**Body:** You've achieved things most people would call "success." You're skilled, self-aware, and getting things done. But something feels off. You're foggy. Scattered. Unmotivated. Disconnected from the work that used to excite you. You keep pushing, but it's not clicking like it used to.

## About

**H2:** Hi, I'm Alex. I've lived both sides of this.

**Body:**

After working in tech for over 8 years, I had what many people call "the dream." I worked remotely, made more money, and had a flexible schedule. But even with all that, I felt off. I looked productive, but inside, I felt lost and tired.

That's when I started looking inward. I went to therapy, wrote in my journal, and worked on myself. Not to just get more done, but to feel clear and steady again. It made a big difference.

And when I started helping others do the same, something clicked. Since then, I've coached over 30 smart, hard-working people who also felt stuck, and helped them find clarity, direction, and momentum they could feel again.

## Process (How It Works)

**H2:** How It Works

1. We start with a free intro call to get to know each other
2. If it feels like a fit, we'll create a coaching plan that works for you
3. Sessions are remote, flexible, and focused on what matters most to you
4. I take on only a few clients at a time, so you get my full focus.

**Closing:** No pressure, no pitch, just a space to think, reflect, and move forward.

## FAQ

A: We'll start with a conversation to explore if coaching fits your needs, with no pressure. It's about finding what works best for you.

A: Sessions are confidential video calls focused entirely on your goals. We use powerful conversations to help you gain clarity and create actionable plans.
