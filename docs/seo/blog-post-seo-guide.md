## 1. Before Writing: Keyword Research

- **Only write about topics people search for.** No search volume = no traffic. Use Ahrefs Keyword Generator to validate.
- **Check keyword difficulty (KD).** Start with Easy KD keywords. You need fewer backlinks to rank.
- **Analyze search intent.** Google your keyword and look at the top 10 results. Note the 3 Cs:
  - **Content type:** Blog post? Listicle? Guide? How-to?
  - **Content format:** Step-by-step? List? Comparison? Definition?
  - **Content angle:** What unique angle do top results take? (Beginners? Experts? Current year?)
- **Target one primary keyword per post.** Don't split focus across multiple unrelated keywords.
- **Find secondary keywords.** Look at "Also rank for" keywords in Ahrefs. Include them naturally.

---

## 2. Title Tag

- **Include your target keyword.** Google uses the title to understand what the page is about.
- **Keep it under 60 characters.** Longer titles get truncated in search results.
- **Include the year if freshness matters.** E.g., "How to Stop Overthinking (2026)" — do this when top results include years.
- **Make it compelling.** Your title competes with 9 other results on page 1. It needs to earn the click.
- **Front-load the keyword.** Put the most important words first.

---

## 3. URL / Slug

- **Use your target keyword as the slug.** `/blog/what-causes-indecisiveness` not `/blog/post-42`.
- **Keep it short and descriptive.** Remove filler words (a, the, and, is, of).
- **Use hyphens, not underscores.** Google treats hyphens as word separators.
- **Never change URLs after publishing** unless absolutely necessary (and set up 301 redirects if you do).

---

## 4. Meta Description

- **Write a unique meta description for every post.** Google sometimes generates its own, but a good one improves CTR.
- **Keep it under 155 characters.**
- **Include the target keyword.** Google bolds matching keywords in search results.
- **Make it a reason to click.** Summarize the value. What will the reader get?
- **Avoid generic descriptions.** "Learn all about X" is wasted space.

---

## 5. Headings (H1, H2, H3)

- **One H1 per page.** This is your post title. Include the primary keyword.
- **Use H2s for main sections.** Think of them as chapters.
- **Use H3s for subsections** under H2s.
- **Include keywords in headings naturally.** Don't force it. Write for humans first.
- **Use headings to create a scannable structure.** Most readers scan before reading.
- **Match heading structure to search intent.** If people search "what causes X," have an H2 that answers that directly.

---

## 6. Content Quality & E-E-A-T

E-E-A-T = Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Not a direct ranking factor, but Google uses signals as proxies.

- **Show first-hand experience.** Write from personal experience, not just research. Google values this.
- **Be specific.** Real numbers, real examples, real names beat vague claims.
- **Be comprehensive.** Cover the topic fully. Check what competitors cover and fill gaps.
- **Be original.** Don't rehash what's already ranking. Add your angle, your data, your experience.
- **Update outdated content.** Refresh posts with new data, remove outdated info. Freshness matters.
- **Author byline matters.** Have a real author with credentials visible on the page.

---

## 7. Internal Linking

This is one of the highest-leverage SEO activities.

- **Link to new posts from existing posts.** Every new post should receive 3-5 internal links from relevant pages.
- **Link from new posts to existing posts.** Cross-reference your own content.
- **Use descriptive anchor text.** "indecisiveness" is better than "click here" or "this article."
- **Link to your most important pages often.** More internal links = more PageRank = higher rankings.
- **Fix orphan pages.** Every page should have at least one internal link pointing to it.
- **Link from high-authority pages.** Your homepage and top-performing pages pass the most value.

---

## 8. Images & Media

- **Use descriptive file names.** `what-causes-indecisiveness.jpg` not `IMG_4521.jpg`.
- **Add alt text to every image.** Describe the image. Include keywords where natural.
- **Compress images.** Large images slow page speed. Use WebP format.
- **Use original images where possible.** Screenshots, diagrams, photos > generic stock.

---

## 9. Technical On-Page

- **Page speed matters.** Aim for good Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms).
- **Mobile-friendly is mandatory.** Google uses mobile-first indexing.
- **Use semantic HTML.** `<article>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>` help search engines and AI understand page structure.
- **Add structured data where relevant.** FAQ schema for FAQ pages, Article schema for blog posts, BreadcrumbList for navigation.
- **Set canonical URLs.** Prevent duplicate content issues. One canonical per page.
- **Use HTTPS.** Non-negotiable.

---

## 10. Featured Snippets & AI Optimization

- **Answer questions directly.** If your keyword is a question, answer it clearly in the first paragraph under the relevant heading.
- **Use definition-style paragraphs.** "Indecisiveness is..." format helps Google extract snippets.
- **Use numbered/bulleted lists.** Google loves pulling these as featured snippets.
- **Optimize for "jobs to be done."** Don't just answer questions — give users tools, templates, frameworks to complete their task.
- **Structured content helps AI.** AI systems (Google AI Overview, ChatGPT, Perplexity) pull from well-structured pages.

---

## 11. After Publishing

- **Submit to Google Search Console.** Request indexing for new posts.
- **Build internal links immediately.** Go to 3-5 existing posts and add links to the new one.
- **Share on social.** LinkedIn, X, Substack — repurpose across platforms.
- **Monitor performance.** Check Search Console after 2-4 weeks. See what queries you're showing up for.
- **Update and improve.** If a post ranks #5-15, improve it. Add depth, update data, improve structure.
- **Build backlinks.** Guest posts, HARO, social sharing, resource pages. Links remain the strongest ranking factor.
