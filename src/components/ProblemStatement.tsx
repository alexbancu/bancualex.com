          You run mental loops all day. Pros and cons lists that go nowhere.
          You beat yourself up for not doing more, then feel too tired to
          start. You chase certainty on decisions that don&apos;t have a
          right answer. None of this is a thinking problem. It&apos;s an
          emotional one. The fog, the stuckness, the exhaustion. Those are
          smoke signals. Something underneath needs your attention.
