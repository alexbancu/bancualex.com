            You run mental loops all day. Pros and cons lists that go nowhere.
            You beat yourself up for not doing more, then feel too tired to start.
          </p>

          <p>
            You chase certainty on decisions that don&apos;t have a right answer.
            None of this is a thinking problem. It&apos;s an emotional one.

          <p>
            The fog, the stuckness, the exhaustion. Something underneath needs
            your attention, and no amount of planning will get you there.
