You've been staring at the same decision for weeks.

Maybe it's a job. Maybe it's a relationship. Maybe it's something smaller that shouldn't take this long. You've made the pros and cons list. You've asked people. You've googled it. You're still stuck.

So you google "what causes indecisiveness" hoping someone will explain what's wrong with you.

Nothing is wrong with you. But something is happening that thinking won't fix.

## Indecisiveness is not a thinking problem

About 20% of adults deal with chronic indecisiveness. That's one in five people who regularly freeze when a decision needs to happen. Psychologist Joseph Ferrari calls it "decisional procrastination" — you keep seeking information, keep weighing options, but never close the loop.

The weird part: indecisive people aren't lazy. They're doing a lot. Reading. Researching. Asking. Comparing. They're working hard. They're just not deciding.

Because deciding isn't the hard part. Deciding means closing a door. And closing a door means feeling something you'd rather not feel.

## The real cause: you can't sit with uncertainty

Psychologist Erik Rassin studied indecisiveness and found one factor underneath most of it: **intolerance of uncertainty.**

People who struggle with decisions aren't missing information. They're allergic to the feeling of not knowing if they picked right. So they keep analyzing. The analysis feels like progress. It's not. It's a way to delay the discomfort of committing.

Think about the last time you got stuck on a decision. Did you actually lack information? Probably not. You had enough to choose. What you lacked was the willingness to live with the possibility of being wrong.

That's the core of it. Indecisiveness isn't a flaw in your reasoning. It's an emotional avoidance strategy dressed up as careful thinking.

## The four habits that keep you stuck

Psychologist Nick Wignall identifies four patterns that maintain indecisiveness. Not what caused it originally — what keeps it going right now.

**Self-doubt on repeat.** You make a tentative choice. Then you question it. Then you question the questioning. Each round of doubt erodes your confidence a little more. The problem isn't the first doubt. Everyone has that. The problem is chasing it with five more.

**Catastrophizing.** You pick an option and immediately imagine the worst version of what happens. The job doesn't work out. The relationship fails. You waste two years. Your brain runs disaster scenarios like it's training for them. It's not helpful. It's a habit.

**Rumination.** You replay past decisions that went badly. The job you took that was wrong. The move you made too early. That evidence builds a case that you're bad at choosing. So why would you trust yourself now?

**People-pleasing.** You filter every option through what other people would think. What your parents expect. What your partner wants. What your peers would respect. Your own preference gets buried under layers of other people's opinions. Hard to decide when you can't hear your own voice.

All four patterns do the same thing: they generate anxiety, and then they try to avoid it. The avoidance feels like safety. But it's what keeps you frozen.

## Why smart people are worse at this

If you're good at thinking — and you probably are, if you're reading this — you have a specific disadvantage.

You've solved hard problems with your brain your whole life. So when a decision feels hard, you reach for the same tool. More research. More angles. More data.

But decisions aren't math. Most real decisions don't have a correct answer. They have trade-offs. And trade-offs require you to feel the loss of the thing you didn't pick. No spreadsheet absorbs that feeling for you.

Researcher Georges Potworowski found that overthinkers spend 50% more time on decisions than decisive people. They don't make better choices. They just spend longer being uncomfortable before making the same ones.

Barry Schwartz, the psychologist behind *The Paradox of Choice*, made this sharper. He split people into two types: maximizers (who need the best possible option) and satisficers (who pick what's good enough). Maximizers analyze more, decide slower, and feel worse after choosing. They experience more regret. More second-guessing. More "what if."

Satisficers aren't dumber. They just have a higher tolerance for imperfection. They can live with "good enough." That's not laziness. That's emotional regulation.

## What indecisiveness is actually protecting you from

When you can't decide, ask yourself: what would I have to feel if I chose?

Usually it's one of these:

**Grief.** Choosing means killing the other option. If you never decide, you never lose anything. But you also never gain anything. You stay in a holding pattern that feels safe but costs you years.

**Responsibility.** If you choose and it goes wrong, that's on you. If you never choose, you can blame the circumstances. Indecision is a way of never being at fault.

**Disappointment.** You might pick something and find out it wasn't what you hoped. Easier to keep imagining all options are good than to pick one and face reality.

**Conflict.** Your choice might upset someone. A parent. A partner. A boss. Staying undecided avoids the confrontation. It also avoids your life.

None of this is conscious. You're not thinking "I'll avoid grief by not deciding." Your system does it automatically. It feels like confusion. Like you need more time. Like you're just not sure yet.

You're sure enough. You're just not willing to feel what comes after choosing.

## What actually helps

**Set a deadline and honor it.** Not for the research phase. For the decision itself. Give yourself 48 hours, a week, whatever fits. When the time comes, choose. Even if it feels premature. The discomfort of choosing too soon is smaller than the cost of never choosing.

**Notice the feeling, not the thought.** When you catch yourself looping through options again, stop. Ask: what am I feeling right now? Not what am I thinking. Fear? Guilt? Sadness? Name it. Sit with it for ten seconds. That's often enough to break the loop.

**Accept that you'll be wrong sometimes.** You will make bad decisions. Everyone does. The question isn't how to avoid bad decisions. It's whether you can recover from them. You can. You have before.

**Stop asking more people.** Every new opinion adds noise. You're not collecting data. You're outsourcing the discomfort of choosing. The answer isn't in your friend's advice. It's in the thing you keep dismissing because it scares you.

**Practice on small decisions.** Order in 30 seconds at a restaurant. Pick a movie in under a minute. Buy the first acceptable option, not the best one. This sounds trivial. It builds the muscle. Decisiveness is a skill, not a trait.

## Indecisiveness is a smoke signal

You're not indecisive because something is broken in your brain. You're indecisive because there's a feeling under the decision that you haven't let yourself have.

The analysis, the list-making, the asking around — that's all avoidance wearing a productive costume. It looks like effort. It feels like progress. It's not.

The way through isn't more information. It's the willingness to choose before you feel ready, and to feel what comes after.

That's where the clarity lives. Not in the research. In the commitment.

If your [thoughts won't stop looping](/blog/feeling-stuck-in-life-and-career) and your decisions keep stalling, that pattern won't fix itself. Sometimes you need someone who asks the questions you're avoiding. That's what [coaching](/coaching) is for.
