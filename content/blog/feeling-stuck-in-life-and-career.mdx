You have the career. The income. The skills people respect.

And you feel stuck.

Not in an obvious way. You're still performing. Still showing up. Nobody around you thinks anything is wrong. But inside, your days feel like wading through mud. You start tasks and stop. You scroll instead of doing the thing you know matters. You plan your next move for the hundredth time and still don't take it.

This isn't laziness. It's not burnout either (though it can look like it). Something else is going on.

## The stuckness is a signal

Most people treat stuckness like a logistics problem. They think they need a better plan, a clearer goal, more information. So they read another book. Take another course. Make another list.

None of it works. Because the problem isn't in your head. It's underneath it.

When you feel stuck in your life and career, your body is trying to tell you something. The fog, the lack of motivation, the inability to decide. These are smoke signals. They point to an emotion you're not letting yourself feel.

Maybe it's fear. Fear that the next step won't work. Fear that you'll lose what you've built. Fear that you'll find out you're not as capable as everyone thinks.

Maybe it's grief. You've outgrown something and you haven't let yourself mourn it yet. The old career identity. The version of success you were chasing. The person you thought you'd be by now.

Maybe it's anger. At yourself for not being further along. At the situation for not making sense. At the gap between what you have and what you feel.

Whatever it is, you've been managing it instead of feeling it. And that management is what's eating your energy.

## Why smart people stay stuck longer

Here's what makes this tricky for high performers.

You're good at thinking. You've solved hard problems your whole life with your brain. So when you feel stuck, you reach for the same tool. More analysis. More pros and cons. More frameworks.

But you can't think your way out of a feeling. Looping thoughts are one of the strongest signs you're avoiding an emotion. The loop feels productive. It feels like you're working on the problem. You're not. You're circling it.

The other trap: self-criticism as motivation. You beat yourself up for being stuck. You call yourself lazy, unfocused, ungrateful. This works for a while. Self-criticism is fuel. But it's dirty fuel. It runs hot and burns out fast.

If you've been pushing yourself with "should" for months or years, your system eventually stops responding. That's not weakness. That's your nervous system protecting you from a pattern that was never sustainable.

## What's actually underneath

When I work with people who feel stuck in their careers, the surface complaint is always the same: "I don't know what I want" or "I can't make a decision" or "I just need to figure out my next step."

But when we slow down and pay attention, something else shows up.

**They know what they want.** They're scared of the consequences of admitting it. Leaving a stable job. Disappointing someone. Starting over. The knowing is there. The willingness to feel what comes with that knowing is what's missing.

**They can make decisions.** They're avoiding the grief of closing a door. Every decision kills an option. If you never pick, you never lose. But you also never move.

**They don't need more clarity.** They need to stop running from what's already clear. The fog isn't confusion. It's protection. Your system is keeping things blurry so you don't have to face what's sharp.

## What helps (and what doesn't)

What doesn't help:

- More planning. You have enough information. You've had enough for a while.
- More input. Another podcast, book, or framework won't move you. You're using learning as a buffer.
- Willpower. Forcing yourself through resistance creates more resistance. The harder you push, the heavier it gets.

What does help:

**Notice what you're feeling, not what you're thinking.** The next time you catch yourself in a loop, stop and ask: what's the feeling underneath this thought? Don't analyze it. Just feel it. Even for ten seconds.

**Stop treating self-criticism like a strategy.** If beating yourself up worked, it would have worked by now. Pay attention to how often the word "should" runs through your head. Every "should" is a small act of aggression against yourself.

**Let yourself want what you want.** Not what makes sense. Not what's safe. Not what other people would approve of. Your desires are data. They're not the problem.

**Talk to someone who won't try to fix you.** Not a friend who'll reassure you. Not a mentor who'll give advice. Someone who'll ask you questions you can't ask yourself. The kind that make you uncomfortable in a useful way. That's what [coaching for people in tech](/coaching) is built for.

## You're not stuck because something is wrong with you

You're stuck because you're human. Specifically, you're a human who got really good at performing and optimizing and achieving, and somewhere along the way you stopped checking in with the part of you that actually knows what it wants.

That part is still there. It's been sending you signals this whole time. The fog. The fatigue. The restlessness. Those are invitations, not problems.

The way out isn't another plan. It's the willingness to feel what you've been avoiding.

That's where the energy comes back. That's where decisions get clear. Not because you figured something out, but because you finally stopped running from what was already there.
